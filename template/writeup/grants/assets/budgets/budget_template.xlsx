- Total Direct Costs
- Total Indirect Costs
- Total Project Cost
- Cost per year breakdown

## Sheet 2: Personnel
- PI, Co-PIs, Postdocs, Graduate Students, etc.
- Salary, benefits, effort percentages
- Annual escalation rates

## Sheet 3: Equipment
- Major equipment items
- Justifications
- Vendor quotes

## Sheet 4: Supplies
- Laboratory supplies
- Computing resources
- Office supplies

## Sheet 5: Travel
- Conference travel
- Collaborative visits
- Field work travel

## Sheet 6: Other Costs
- Publication costs
- Software licenses
- Consultant fees

For actual use, replace this with a proper Excel template.
