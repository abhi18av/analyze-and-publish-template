# My [Duration] Journey with [Project Name]: The Real Story

<!--truncate-->

## The Beginning: How It All Started üå±

### The Initial Spark
[What motivated this project? A problem you encountered? A conversation? A dataset you stumbled upon?]

### What I Thought This Would Be
**My naive assumptions:**
- [Assumption 1: e.g., "This would take 3 months max"]
- [Assumption 2: e.g., "The data would be clean and ready"]
- [Assumption 3: e.g., "A simple linear model would work fine"]

**The plan in my head:**
[Your original timeline and approach - the one that seems laughably optimistic now]

### The Real Goal vs The Stated Goal
**What I told everyone:** [The official project description]
**What I actually wanted to prove:** [Your personal hypothesis or curiosity]
**What the stakeholders really wanted:** [What you discovered they cared about]

## The Honeymoon Phase (Weeks 1-[X]) üíï

### Early Wins That Felt Like Magic
[Small victories that made you think this would be easy]

### The First Look at the Data
**What I expected:** [Your assumptions about data quality/structure]
**What I found:** [The reality - missing values, weird formats, unexpected patterns]

```python
# The moment of truth
print(df.info())
# [Include the actual horrifying output that made your heart sink]
```

### Red Flags I Ignored
- [Warning sign 1 that you brushed off]
- [Warning sign 2 that seemed minor at the time]
- [Warning sign 3 that you thought you could work around]

### The Data Nightmares
[Specific examples of data problems that ate weeks of your time]

```python
# The code that haunted my dreams
# [Include actual problematic data examples]
```

## The Dark Period (Weeks [Y]-[Z]) üåë

### When I Wanted to Quit
[Describe the lowest point - the moment you seriously considered giving up]

**The breaking point:** [What finally made you hit rock bottom]
**Imposter syndrome hits:** [How you questioned your abilities]
