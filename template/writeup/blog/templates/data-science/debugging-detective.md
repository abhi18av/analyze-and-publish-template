**How I ruled it out:** [The evidence that eliminated this theory]
**What I learned:** [Insight gained despite the dead end]

### False Lead #2: [Another Misleading Clue]
**The compelling evidence:** [What made this seem right]
**The investigation process:** [What you did to test this]
**The moment I realized it was wrong:** [When and how you knew]
**The emotional cost:** [How it felt to waste time on this]

### False Lead #3: [Third Misleading Clue]
**Why this was tempting:** [Appeal of this explanation]
**The rabbit hole:** [How deep you went with this theory]
**The wake-up call:** [What brought you back to reality]

## The Breakthrough Moment üí°

### When Everything Changed
