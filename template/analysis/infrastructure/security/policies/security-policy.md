# Security Policy
# All resources and configurations must adhere to the following policy.

## General Security Guidelines
- All infrastructure code and configurations must be reviewed for security implications.
- Secrets must not be hardcoded in the codebase.
- Sensitive and personal data must be handled with care.
- All deployments must have monitoring and logging enabled.

## Code Scanning and Security Tools
- Code scanning tools like Bandit, Safety, Trivy, and tfsec should be part of CI/CD pipelines.
- Vulnerability patches and updates to critical systems should be implemented promptly.

## Access Control
- Least privilege principle should be applied for all roles in IAM.
- Multi-factor authentication must be enabled where supported.
- SSH access to servers should be limited to the team network unless explicitly required.

## Network Security
- Firewalls and security groups should be configured to allow only necessary traffic.
- Network segmentation should be implemented to isolate environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
- All unused ports and services must be disabled.

## Data Security
- Disk encryption must be enabled for sensitive data storage.
- Backup and recovery plans should be tested regularly.
- Data lifecycle management should be defined and enforced.

## Application Security
- Web applications must validate inputs and sanitize outputs to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS).
- Regular penetration testing must be conducted.

# Compliance and Auditing
- All security operations and changes must be logged, with appropriate alerting mechanisms in place.
- Compliance audits should be performed at least annually, including checks against SOC 2, GDPR, or relevant standards.

# Incident Response
- Define and document incident response procedures.
- Ensure regular training and simulation exercises for the incident response team.
