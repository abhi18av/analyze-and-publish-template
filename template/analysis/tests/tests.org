* Software Testing Concepts for Your Data Science Template

Based on your template structure, here are ways to incorporate software testing principles:

** 1. Unit Testing
- Add =/tests= directories in Python and R components with:
  - Test fixtures for common data structures
  - Tests for utility functions in =lib/= folders
  - Parameterized tests for data transformations

** 2. Integration Testing
- Create pipeline tests that validate entire workflows:
  - Test data preprocessing → modeling → evaluation chains
  - Verify Docker container builds and runs correctly
  - Test Terraform configurations with =terratest=

** 3. Test-Driven Development for Analytics
- Implement hypothesis testing pattern:
  - Define expected outcomes for analyses
  - Write tests before implementing analytical code
  - Document assumptions with assertion statements

** 4. Data Validation Testing
- Add schema validation for input/output data
- Create data quality tests with Great Expectations
- Test data pipelines with known sample data

** 5. Model Testing
- Implement performance benchmark tests
- Test model serialization/deserialization
- Validate model behavior with synthetic edge cases

** 6. CI/CD Test Integration
- Add GitHub Actions workflows in =.github/workflows/=
- Implement pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- Create smoke tests for deployed artifacts

** 7. Property-Based Testing
- Test data transformations with generated test data
- Verify invariants that should hold across analyses

These testing approaches would significantly improve reliability and reproducibility in your data science workflow.
