This is a comprehensive template built with [Copier](https://github.com/copier-org/copier) for creating professional data science projects that scale from exploration to publication. It provides a complete workflow covering data analysis, machine learning, academic writing, and deployment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```shell
# Create a new project
copier copy gh:abhi18av/template-analysis-and-writeup my-analysis-project
cd my-analysis-project

# Set up the development environment
just setup

# Start your first analysis
just notebooks new-eda "initial-exploration"
```

## Features

### Project structure

It is assumed that most of the work will be done in Jupyter Notebooks.
However, the template also includes a python project, in which you can put functions and classes shared across notebooks.
The repository is set up to use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for unit testing this module code.

The template also includes a `data` directory whose contents will be ignored by git.
You can use this folder to store data that you do not commit.
You may also put a readme file in which you can document the source datasets you use and how to acquire them.

### [just](https://github.com/casey/just)

`just` is a command runner that allows you to easily to run project-specific commands.
In fact, you can use `just` to run all the setup commands listed below:

```shell
just setup
```

### [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

pre-commit is a tool that runs checks on your files before you commit them with git, thereby helping ensure code quality.
Enable it with the following command:

```shell
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

The configuration is stored in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Github Actions

You may optionally add a github workflow file which checks the following:

- uses ruff to check files are formatted and linted
- Runs unit tests and checks coverage
- Checks any markdown files are formatted with [markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2)
- Checks that all jupyter notebooks are clean

### [Typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos)

Typos checks for common typos in code, aiming for a low false positive rate.
The repository is configured not to use it for Jupyter notebook files, as it tends to find errors in cell outputs.

The template uses several configuration files:

- `copier.yml`: Template configuration
- `pyproject.toml`: Python project settings
- `justfile`: Task automation
- `dvc.yaml`: Data pipeline definition
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Code quality hooks

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for sensitive configuration:

```shell
# Experiment tracking
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://your-mlflow-server.com
WANDB_API_KEY=your-wandb-key

# Cloud credentials
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret

# Database connections
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/db
```

### Customization Options

When generating a project, you can customize:

- Programming languages (Python, R, both)
- Experiment tracking platform
- Documentation format
- Deployment options
- Infrastructure components

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Multi-Language Support

The template supports multiple programming languages with consistent structure:

```shell
# Python analysis
just notebooks new-experiment "python-analysis" "02-exploration" --lang=python

# R analysis  
just notebooks new-experiment "r-analysis" "02-exploration" --lang=r

# Julia analysis
just notebooks new-experiment "julia-analysis" "02-exploration" --lang=julia
```

### Data Validation

Integrated data validation with multiple frameworks:

```python
# Use Great Expectations
from analysis.validation import create_expectation_suite
suite = create_expectation_suite(df, "customer_data")

# Use Pandera schemas
from analysis.validation import validate_dataframe
validated_df = validate_dataframe(df, "customer_schema")
```

### Experiment Tracking

Automatic experiment logging:

```python
# MLflow integration
import mlflow
with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("model_type", "random_forest")
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.95)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```
