# Case Studies

This folder contains real-world examples demonstrating the successful application of research templates in various academic and research contexts.

## Purpose

Case studies showcase:
- **Practical applications** of templates in real projects
- **Problem-solving approaches** using the template system
- **Lessons learned** and best practices
- **Quantifiable benefits** and outcomes
- **Diverse use cases** across different research domains

## Structure

Each case study should include:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Brief overview of the project and outcomes
- Key metrics and benefits achieved

### 2. Background and Challenge
- Research context and domain
- Specific problems or requirements
- Why existing solutions weren't sufficient

### 3. Solution Implementation
- How templates were applied
- Customizations and adaptations made
- Tools and technologies used

### 4. Results and Outcomes
- Quantifiable improvements
- Workflow efficiency gains
- Quality improvements
- Time savings

### 5. Lessons Learned
- What worked well
- Challenges encountered
- Recommendations for similar projects

### 6. Technical Details
- Architecture diagrams
- Code snippets
- Configuration examples
- Performance metrics

## Writing Guidelines

1. **Be specific**: Use concrete examples and real numbers
2. **Show, don't just tell**: Include screenshots, code, and outputs
3. **Balance technical and business aspects**: Appeal to both technical and non-technical readers
4. **Maintain anonymity**: Protect sensitive information while preserving instructional value
5. **Include failure stories**: Document what didn't work and why

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `bioinformatics-pipeline-case-study.qmd`
- Include domain: `finance-risk-modeling.qmd`
- Indicate complexity: `complex-multi-lab-collaboration.qmd`

# Single case study
quarto render genomics-data-analysis.qmd

# All case studies
quarto render

# With specific format
quarto render genomics-data-analysis.qmd --to pdf
```

## Contribution Guidelines

### Submitting Case Studies
1. Use the provided template structure
2. Include all required sections
3. Provide sufficient technical detail
4. Ensure reproducibility where possible
5. Review for sensitive information

### Review Process
- Technical accuracy verification
- Clarity and completeness check
- Anonymization review
- Integration with existing documentation

## Metrics and Impact

Case studies should demonstrate:
- **Time savings**: Hours or days saved in workflow
- **Error reduction**: Fewer bugs or inconsistencies
- **Collaboration improvement**: Better team coordination
- **Publication success**: Faster time to publication
- **Reproducibility**: Ability to replicate results

## Integration with Website

Case studies are featured prominently on the main website and cross-referenced with relevant walkthroughs and documentation.
